## The _Mining the Social Web_ Virtual Machine

_You may enjoy [this short screencast](https://vimeo.com/72383764) that demonstrates the step-by-step instructions involved in installing the book's virtual machine._

The code for _Mining the Social Web_ is organized by chapter in an [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) format to maximize enjoyment of following along with examples as part of an interactive experience. Unfortunately, some of the Python dependencies for the example code can be a little bit tricky to get installed and configured, so providing a completely turn-key virtual machine to make your reading experience as simple and enjoyable as possible is in order. Even if you are a seasoned developer, you may still find some value in using this virtual machine to get started and save yourself some time. The virtual machine is powered with [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/), an amazing development tool that you'll probably want to know about and arguably makes working with virtualization even easier than a native [Virtualbox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) or VMWare image.  

## Quick Start Guide

The recommended way of getting started with the example code is by taking advantage of the Vagrant-powered virtual machine as illusrated in [this short screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTyKPMfi_JQ). After all, you're more interested in following along and learning from the examples than installing and managing all of the system dependencies just to get to that point, right? 

[Appendix A - Virtual Machine Experience](https://rawgithub.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/master/ipynb/html/_Appendix A - Virtual Machine Experience.html) provides clear step-by-step instructions for installing the virtual machine and is intended to serve as a quick start guide.


## The _Mining the Social Web_ Wiki

This project takes advantage of its GitHub repository's [wiki](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/wiki) to act as a point of collaboration for consumers of the source code. Feel free to use the wiki however you'd like to share your experiences, and create additional pages as needed to curate additional information.

One of the more important wiki pages that you may want to bookmark is the [Advisories](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/wiki/Advisories) page, which is an archive of notes about particularly disruptive commits or other changes that may affect you.

Another page of interest is a listing of all [100+ numbered examples](https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/wiki/Numbered-Examples) from the book that conveniently hyperlink to read-only version of the IPython Notebooks
