Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine. He invented the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_302_telephone\"><em>I Love Lucy</em> black telephone</a> and the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Honeywell_round_thermostat.jpg\">round thermostat</a>. It's these staples that are everyday life that you don't realize, like, \"Wow, someone thought through this design and it's a massive success.\" Research, I would say, is the next set of skills. </p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/247675646&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WesternElectric302.jpg\">ProhibitOnions on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=moeZSnFvq3A:C6_OT5TX_qM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=moeZSnFvq3A:C6_OT5TX_qM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=moeZSnFvq3A:C6_OT5TX_qM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=moeZSnFvq3A:C6_OT5TX_qM:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=moeZSnFvq3A:C6_OT5TX_qM:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=moeZSnFvq3A:C6_OT5TX_qM:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=moeZSnFvq3A:C6_OT5TX_qM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/moeZSnFvq3A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>, our podcast exploring how experience design\u2014and experience designers\u2014are shaping business, the Internet of Things, and other domains: <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-design-podcast/id1022433707?intcmp=il-design-na-na-na_20150820_design_podcast_subscribe_top_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Design Podcast</a></strong>, our podcast exploring how experience design&mdash;and experience designers&mdash;are shaping business, the Internet of Things, and other domains: <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/oreilly-design-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Design-Podcast-p771040/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-design-podcast/id1022433707\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/oreilly-design-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/mval_omN-dea\">RSS</a>.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:WesternElectric302.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81793\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-WesternElectric302.jpg\" alt=\"350px-WesternElectric302\" width=\"350\" height=\"289\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81793\" /></a>\n<p>In this week's Design Podcast episode, I sit down with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scotthurff\">Scott Hurff,</a> product manager and lead designer at Tinder, Inc.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

Hurff is the author of <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920038917.do?intcmp=il-design-books-videos-product-na_20160217_radar_scott_hurff_design_podcast_post_body_book_link\"><em>Designing Products People Love</em></a>. In this episode, we talk about how Tinder approaches design, avoiding awkward UI, and why customer research is the most important skill for future designers.\n</p>\n<p>Here are a few highlights from our conversation:\n</p>\n<h2>Questions of structure</h2>\n<blockquote><p>At Tinder, the product team is about five people, six people. What's interesting is that we're trying to grow really quickly. There's a give and take on how we divide up product design responsibilities and product management responsibilities. There is a lot of engineering talent here, and they need a lot of product to work on. It's a matter of, how do we structure ourselves so we can give them thought-through, packaged-up, ready-to-go ideas and concepts while still hammering out the details in time.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Design as a full-contact sport</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Design is such a part of the Tinder experience. It may not seem like that's the case because it's such a simple app, but that's only because everything goes through this distillation process. You have to really fight for real estate and your idea. Design's really a full-contact sport here. You have to bring in all the big guns to make your case. Sometimes these can be really long debates, but they're good; they're healthy. They get the ideas out on the table, and a lot of times, design really has to be put through its bases to prove itself.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Awkward UI</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Awkward UI is that feeling you get when you're using a digital product and something doesn't feel right. I had been struggling on what to call that or even what it was. The example I used, because I use Apple TV a ton, is when I'm loading my library, my personal library&mdash;movies, or TV shows, or whatever&mdash;and I select \"All Titles\" or whatever the menu item is, and it just sits there, blank. There's no loader, there's no indication of activity; I think, \"Oh, man. There's been some fluke.\" I do this every time. I use this a lot and I still feel this way every time. \"Is the Internet down? Did Apple erase all my movies?\" You start to go through these panic modes, and then, \"Oh, there they are. Oh, everything's fine.\" It just snaps into place, it just appears out of nowhere. As humans, we need to see motion from start to finish. Things don't just drop into place out of thin air, unless you're in Star Trek or something.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Five states of the UI Stack</h2>\n<blockquote><p>I call this the \"UI Stack,\" where it's building on the idea from way back when 37signals, now Basecamp, wrote this great book, <a href=\"https://gettingreal.37signals.com/\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, in '06; it was a big influence on me. They invented the \"Three State Solution,\" where it was blank state, ideal state, and error state, I believe. Really, there are more. There's more to it than that, especially since mobile apps have introduced touch-based UIs. There's really, I think, five states. The UI Stack consists of those five states: blank, error, ideal, partial, and loading. When a UI doesn't have those states, it feels weird, and it presents you with a jarring feeling. Part of the whole premise of moving between these states is that you show the progression. You show the progression from blank, to partial, to loading, and back and forth.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Don't forget the past</h2>\n<blockquote><p>An important skill for designers is being able to interpret customer research and being able to actually perform it. The big source of everything is that my products exist is to find a customer. If you don't know who that customer is or if you are thrown off by whatever and going after the wrong person or group of people because of that, you're going to waste a ton of time and money. I think designers need to be able to at least detect if things were done or if research was conducted soundly. If it's not, then find someone who can do that for them because I think technology has gotten a pass, where we've embedded in our culture this \"raise a bunch of money, burn the ships mentality, ship it, fill faster,\" that whole thing. We've been able to get away with that because of this sheer mass of the market; there's so many devices coming online, there's so many potential customers out there, and I think it's led us to forget the practices of the past.\n</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The staples of everyday life</h2>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dreyfuss\">Henry Dreyfuss</a>, one of the greatest industrial product designers ever, like the Steve Jobs of the 30s and 40s, made reassertions and actually sitting down and doing what his customers were doing part of his routine.

However, software is a much more realistic business proposition for a robotics startup, especially if you leverage open source to create a developer community around your product and let others innovate through what you\u2019ve built.</i></li>\n<li><A href=\"http://svail.github.io/mandarin/\">Getting Deep Speech to Work in Mandarin</a> (Baidu SVAIL) -- TIL that some of the preprocessing traditionally used in speech-to-text systems throws away pitch information necessary to decode tonal languages like Mandarin. <i>Deep Speech doesn\u2019t use specialized features like MFCCs. We train directly from the spectrogram of the input audio signal. The spectrogram is a fairly general representation of an audio signal.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about.

In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure.

Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about.

In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

They chat about evolutionary computation, its applications in deep learning, and how it's inspired by biology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>Finding optimal solutions</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>We talk about evolutionary computation as a way of solving problems, discovering solutions that are optimal or as good as possible. In these complex domains like, maybe, simulated multi-legged robots that are walking in challenging conditions&mdash;a slippery slope or a field with obstacles&mdash;there are probably many different solutions that will work. If you run the evolution multiple times, you probably will discover some different solutions. There are many paths of constructing that same solution. You have a population and you have some solution components discovered here and there, so there are many different ways for evolution to run and discover roughly the same kind of a walk, where you may be using three legs to move forward and one to push you up the slope if it's a slippery slope.</p>\n<p>You do (relatively) reliably discover the same solutions, but also, if you run it multiple times, you will discover others. This is also a new direction or recent direction in evolutionary computation&mdash;that the standard formulation is that you are running a single run of evolution and you try to, in the end, get the optimum. Everything in the population supports finding that optimum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Biological inspiration</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Some machine learning is simply statistics. It's not simple, obviously, but it is really based on statistics and it's mathematics-based, but some of the inspiration in evolutionary computation and neural networks and reinforcement learning really comes from biology. It doesn't mean that we are trying to systematically replicate what we see in biology.</p>\n<p>We take the components we understand, or maybe even misunderstand, but we take the components that make sense and put them together into a computational structure. That's what's happening in evolution, too. Some of the core ideas at the very high level of instruction are the same. In particular, there's selection acting on variation. That's the main principle of evolution in biology, and it's also in computation. If you take a little bit more detailed view, we have a population, and everyone is evaluated, and then we select the best ones, and those are the ones that reproduce the most, and we get a new population that's more likely to be better than the previous population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Modeling biology? Not quite yet.</h2>\n<blockquote><p>There's also developmental processes that most biological systems adapt and learn during their lifetime as well. In humans, the genes specify, really, a very weak starting point. When a baby is born, there's very little behavior that they can perform, but over time, they interact with the environment and that neural network gets set into a system that actually deals with the world. Yes, there's actually some work in trying to incorporate some of these ideas, but that is very difficult. We are very far from actually saying that we really model biology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>OSCAR-6 innovates</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What got us really hooked in this area was that there are these demonstrations where evolution not only optimizes something that you know pretty well, but also comes up with something that's truly novel, something that you don't anticipate. For us, it was this one application where we were evolving a controller for a robot arm, OSCAR-6. It was six degrees of freedom, but you only needed three to really control it. One of the dimensions is that the robot can turn around its vertical axis, the main axis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to get the fingers of the robot to a particular location in 3D space that's reachable. It's pretty easy to do. We were working on putting obstacles in the way and accidentally disabled the main motor, the one that turns the robot around its main axis. We didn't know it. We ran evolution anyway, and evolution learned and evolved, found a solution that would get the fingers in the goal, but it took five times longer. We only understood what was going on when we put it on screen and looked at the visualization.</p>\n<p>What the robot was able to do was that when the target was, say, all the way to the left and it needed to turn around the main axis to get the arm close to it, it couldn't do it because it couldn't turn. Instead, it turned the arm from the elbow or shoulder, the other direction, away from the goal, then swung it back real hard; because of inertia, the whole robot would turn around its main axis, even when there was no motor.</p>\n<p>This was a big surprise. We caused big problems to the robot. We disabled a big, important component of it, but it still found a solution of dealing with it: utilizing inertia, utilizing the physical simulation to get where it needed to go. This is exactly what you would like in a machine learning system. It innovates. It finds things that you did not think about. If you have a robot stuck in a rock in Mars or it loses a wheel, you'd still like it to complete its mission.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata. Source: Joe Hellerstein, used with permission.</em>[/caption]</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let me talk about the kinds of things I think a metadata store in the big data space needs to do in its fullness. One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>TuneIn<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>SoundCloud<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata. Source: Joe Hellerstein, used with permission.</em>[/caption]</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let me talk about the kinds of things I think a metadata store in the big data space needs to do in its fullness. One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving.

How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata. Source: Joe Hellerstein, used with permission.</em>[/caption]</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let me talk about the kinds of things I think a metadata store in the big data space needs to do in its fullness. One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>, that comes out of my group.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>[/caption]<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata. Source: Joe Hellerstein, used with permission.</em>[/caption]</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let me talk about the kinds of things I think a metadata store in the big data space needs to do in its fullness. One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>Let me talk about the kinds of things I think a metadata store in the big data space needs to do in its fullness.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>metadata services<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata. Source: Joe Hellerstein, used with permission.</em>[/caption]</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let me talk about the kinds of things I think a metadata store in the big data space needs to do in its fullness. One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata. Source: Joe Hellerstein, used with permission.</em>[/caption]</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let me talk about the kinds of things I think a metadata store in the big data space needs to do in its fullness. One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata. Source: Joe Hellerstein, used with permission.</em>[/caption]</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let me talk about the kinds of things I think a metadata store in the big data space needs to do in its fullness. One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>Data wrangling gets a fresh look<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220?intcmp=il-data-na-na-na_20150826_radar_data_show_podcast_post_top_subscribe_cta\">Subscribe to the O'Reilly Data Show Podcast</a></strong> to explore the opportunities and techniques driving big data and data science: <a href=\"//www.stitcher.com/podcast/oreilly-media-2/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast?refid=stpr\u201d\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/OReilly-Data-Show-p670015/\">TuneIn</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/oreilly-data-show/id944929220\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/oreilly-radar/sets/the-oreilly-data-show-podcast\">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=\"http://feeds.podtrac.com/IOJSwQcdEBcg\">RSS</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81739\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.jpg\" alt=\"350px-Hand_made_dense_labyrinth\" width=\"350\" height=\"251\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-81739\" /></a>\n<p>In this episode of the O'Reilly Data Show, I spoke with one of the most popular speakers at <a href=\"http://www.strataconf.com\">Strata+Hadoop World</a>: \u00a0Joe Hellerstein, p<a href=\"http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/\">rofessor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/about-us/leadership/\">co-founder/CSO of Trifacta</a>.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata.

How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data.

We talked about his past and current academic research (which spans <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction\">HCI</a>, databases, and systems), data wrangling, large-scale distributed systems, and his recent work on metadata services.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/246374456&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Data wrangling and preparation</h2>\n<blockquote><p>The most interactive tasks that people do with data are essentially data wrangling. You're changing the form of the data, you're changing the content of the data, and at the same time you're trying to evaluate the quality of the data and see if you're making it the way you want it. \u2026 It's really actually the most immersive interaction that people do with data and it's very interesting.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>\u2026 Actually, there's a long tradition of research in the database community on data cleaning and some on data transformation languages, some of that work from my group, and certainly lots of work from many, many others. You will see papers about that. It tends to be more algorithmic and automated traditionally. Most of that work was, 'I've invented an algorithm. It can do entity resolution ten percent better than the previous algorithm, and let me show you how it works.' I think a distinguishing factor in the work that we've been doing is that we've reached out to researchers in human-computer interaction, people like Jeff Heer, who focus on things like visualization, things like interaction models, and we asked, 'Well, it's nice to have an algorithm, but how will the person using this algorithm actually iterate over the data?' That raises different and equally interesting, or maybe more interesting in my opinion, technical challenges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Coordination and consistency in distributed systems</h2>\n<blockquote><p>What's the fundamental bottleneck in scale and in performance? \u2026 \u00a0When you read the systems and the big data papers, it's all about coordination. It's the cost of a machine in California waiting for an answer from a machine in London to just get permission to do what it wants to do. Coordination algorithms&mdash;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)\">locking</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)\">Paxos</a>&mdash;\u2026 are very expensive. The big question we all had was: How can you get correct semantics on your data and correct execution in your programs if you don't coordinate, if the systems don't bother checking in with each other to make sure everything's okay? </p>\n<p>\u2026 Achieving consistency without coordination is the big goal. NoSQL is very much about saying, 'Forget about consistency. Let's just avoid coordination.' What the goal in the research community has been over the bunch of years is to say, 'Well, that's not a good trade off. Can we get both? Can we get consistency without coordination?' The answer turns out to be lots of times, yes, and there's been lots of mechanism and fundamentals both in this space that are ... going to be really powerful tools for computing going forward.</p>\n<p>\u2026 What I'd say instead is that you can achieve strong consistency in a very broad set of tasks. One of the key results in this is the <a href=\"http://bloom-lang.net/calm/\">CALM theorem: consistency as logical monotonicity</a>, that comes out of my group. The CALM theorem shows that any polynomial time algorithm can be implemented without coordination and achieve a consistent outcome, which means that basically anything you want to compute in a reasonable amount of time over large amounts of data doesn't really require coordination. Now, that's a theory result. Mapping it to practice is going to be the work of many years and lots of clever ideas, but fundamentally I think it's quite broadly applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Vendor-neutral metadata services</h2>\n<p>As Hellerstein discussed, the use cases for metadata are varied and evolving. Some key uses of metadata and metadata stores include interpreting data, tracking data usage by multiple users, and surfacing patterns and associations among many data sets.</p>\n<p>[caption id=\"attachment_81743\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"Joe Hellerstein, used with permission\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-81743\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2016/02/600px-metadata2-joe-nyc-2015.jpg\" alt=\"Use cases for metadata\" width=\"600\" height=\"301\" class=\"size-full wp-image-81743\" /></a> <em>Use cases for metadata. Source: Joe Hellerstein, used with permission.</em>[/caption]</p>\n<blockquote><p>Let me talk about the kinds of things I think a metadata store in the big data space needs to do in its fullness. One of them obviously is it needs to be a place where you put your data inventory. That's the standard stuff. What data do I have? How's it named? How's it typed? How's it structured? How's it accessed? What kinds of things are in it? Most of these systems at minimum need to do that. That's fine. A second layer that I think is critical moving forward ... is data usage. Every time an analyst does a thing to a data set and generates some output, we should be tracking that because there is gold in those hills. Every time someone puts in time and skill into analyzing data and using it, that's generating metadata that could be useful to your organization.</p>\n<p>\u2026 I think we want to use metadata for organizational improvements. Who knows about this data? Expert sourcing. Who knows about data that references customer X? Maybe somebody did a study of sales to customer X, and you can find that out. Who knows about this data set? Then there's things like, if you're working with this data set, you might be interested in this other data set. There's a kind of recommender system version of this relative to data. There are lots of things you can do beyond make the system go faster if you know how people are working with the data. It's really a graph of people and data and algorithms interacting. It evolves over time and you want to mine that graph for patterns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Joe Hellerstein will speak about <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47237?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">metadata services</a> and <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca/public/schedule/detail/47405?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_session_link\">data wrangling</a> at <a href=\"http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-ca?intcmp=il-data-confreg-lp-stca16_20160209_radar_joe_hellerstein_data_show_post_conference_link\">Strata + Hadoop World in San Jose this March</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Related resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-open-and-vendor-neutral-metadata-services\">We need open and vendor-neutral metadata services</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/lessons-from-next-generation-data-wrangling-tools.html\">Lessons from next-generation data wrangling tools</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/11/data-wrangling-gets-a-fresh-look.html\">Data wrangling gets a fresh look</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image by <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hand_made_dense_labyrinth.png\">xOneca on Wikimedia Commons</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?i=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:JEwB19i1-c4\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?a=uXEnwAwAYo4:kIc8Z7X_C0g:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/oreilly/radar/atom?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uXEnwAwAYo4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>\n",
